# Notes

## Things that make a kid a kid (or things that adults tend to avoid)

### Lookings things up-close:

GZZ_Mechelen_31_Austria-Venice-boat-S-Afr.mp4

- Very distant images, tries to cover a lot of visual information, compromises detail and privileges long shots (already knows and understand what is contained, no need to get so close).
- The model has less frequent detections (lacks visual detail to detect each object, reiterates long distance / less detail and less detection, the viewer does not need it, already knows even with little information)
- There is a theatrical event, do we know what it is simulating? from conext seems to be mocking slavery or rituals.
- Camera mostly seems 3/4 angle up or down, not so much front.

0041_GZZ_MathieuM_bob01_kivu.18.mp4

- Similar distance in the images but for differnt reasons: shows landscapes, wild animals from afar (safari), the close images seem of volcanic rocks? ends with a sunset.

0040_GZZ_MathieuM_Anvers-Stan.mp4

- Same codes as 0041_GZZ_MathieuM_bob01_kivu.18 but for city lanscape. City birds and lizards are recorded from a very close view.

AI can actually measure distance

Humans can fictionalice
